### This is our 2nd Year 2nd Semester ITP Project, which is an "Agri-waste Management System" that helps to manage agricultural waste generated from the agricultural activities. By this application we are trying to connect farmers with agri-waste buyers and recycling companies by providing a e-commerce platform to buy and sell agricultural waste. This application is developed using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) technology.
