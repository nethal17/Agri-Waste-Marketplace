# This is our 2nd Year 2nd Semester ITP Project which is a dynamic web application that support to manage Agricultural Waste which generates from the agricultural activities. By this application we are trying to connect farmers with Agri-Waste buyers and recycling companies by providing a platform to buy and sell agricultural waste. This application is developed using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) technology. This is our 70% progress of the project and we are still working on it.
